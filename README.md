# RedWine-Analysis
It is an experimental analysis of a red wine dataset in order to figure out the right amount of "features" that make uo its composition.
The project consists of four parts.
EDA where we find the distributions or correlations of the wines quality.
PCA where we reduce the dimensionality.
And a machine learning part.
